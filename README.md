## 2016 Presidential Election Analysis
In this study, I address the problems that arose when predicting the 2016 presidential election
and search for the significant demographics in predicting a county’s majority vote. I fit six different 
classification models that would predict a county's majority vote given that county's census information,
and conclude that the lasso regression model is the most appropriate
for predicting the election. Further, I found that the most significant
predictors were the percent of population who are white and percent of population who
commute on public transportation.

Finally, I use those same classification methods only on
counties who voted Democratic in the 2012 election to predict which counties would switch
parties in the 2016 election. I determine that in this case, a logistic regression model is
most appropriate, and conclude that the most significant predictors in whether a
formerly Democratic county stayed Democratic or flipped was that county’s proportion of
white population and proportion of individuals working in particular job sectors.
