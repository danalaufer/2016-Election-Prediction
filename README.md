## 2016 Presidential Election Analysis
# Overview
In this study, I address the problems that arose when predicting the 2016 presidential election, 
and search for the significant demographics in predicting a county’s majority vote. In addition,
I investigate the nature of counties whose majority vote changed parties from the 2012 to 2016. 
Using data on the 2016 presidential election and demographics, I first perform principal component 
analysis and hierarchical clustering to see any natural groupings
of counties based on census data. Then, I use various classification methods to predict a
county’s vote in the 2016 election based on census data, concluding that the most significant
predictors were the percent of population who are white and percent of population who
commute on public transportation. Finally, I use those same classification methods only on
counties who voted Democratic in the 2012 election to predict which counties would switch
parties in the 2016 election. I concluded that the most significant predictors in whether a
formerly Democratic county stayed Democratic or flipped was that county’s proportion of
white population and proportion of individuals working in particular job sectors.
